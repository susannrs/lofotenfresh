        <h3>Administrative detaljer</h3>
        <h4>Vår kunde</h4>
        <p>Sigur Skarby, eier av Lofoten Fresh.</p>
        <p>Sigur er fra Lofoten, men bor for tiden i Trondheim. Han jobber på Nidar som industrikokk. Drømmen er likevel å starte en egen bedrift i Lofoten.
           For Sigur er lokale og gode råvarer viktig, og han vil gjerne innovere den unike mattradisjonen fra Lofoten gjennom Lofoten Fresh. Visjonen til Lofoten Fresh er i tråd med slow-foodbevegelsen.</p>

        <h3>Hensikt og mål</h3>
        <p>Lofoten Fresh er en sesongbasert foodtruck. Om somrene er det en restaurant for fast slow-food, som han tenker skal være stasjonert et fast sted. På vintrene vil inntekten basere seg på å selge gode råvarer til den lokale befolkningen, eller å flytte foodtrucken rundt i Norges land. Han håper også på at vinterturismen skal ta seg opp. I tillegg vil han tilby catering til større arranngement.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kundene skal få informasjon om at Lofoten Fresh og konseptet til bedriften.</li>
            <li>Det skal være tilgang til menyen for foodtrucken.</li>
            <li>Sanntids plassering av foodtrucken skal være synlig for besøkende.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Navgiasjons Struktur</h3>
        <p>A brief discussion about the site's navigation structure using
          the terminology learned in class and the notes on slides “HTML Cont.” in Storyboard
          and Structures sections (slides:122-129). This is not a sketch of your navbar (or
          whatever), but instead a map or description of which pages connect to which other
          pages. (It is sometimes better to describe a clique in words than to try to draw it.) The
          goal is to explain why the choice of a particular structure makes sense for your
          website.

      <section>
        <h3>Sideoppsett og utseende</h3>
        <p>A description of design decisions that are universal
          to your site. You should specify in writing the fonts (types and sizes), the color
          scheme (for text, background, links, shadows, borders, etc.), navbar position in the
          page and its appearance, banner, footer, the social icons bar, or background images
          (if any of them is applicable). In addition to the textual description of these elements,
          you should include a mockup image of this generic page that has only these common
          elements and no other content. Finally, you should describe how these universal
          design decisions fulfill certain goals of the website and its audience.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Innhold</h3>
        <p>This is the longest section of your document. For every page, you will need
          to give a text description of the content of the page as well as an image of the
          mockup of the page. The text describes what goal(s) this page fulfills, and how
          design decisions specific to it contribute to fulfilling such goals. The reason why you
          should describe the content is that you might not have yet received the actual content
          from the client and in your mockup of the page, you will be using fake text, fake
          images, etc. While the content can be fake, you should try to use meaningful
          headings and captions to convey its meaning. Finally, you should describe the design
          decisions that are unique for this particular page (if any).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Minimums krav</h3>
        <p>The website must include four distinct JavaScript
          applications (for example, rollover effects on images or menus, user-defined
          functions, form validation, animations, etc.). The four applications must all be
          different from each other. Clearly, indicate how each of you will be fulfilling these
          minimum requirements.
          Please note that each of these items must be constructed entirely by you and not copied
          from external websites on the Web (though you can modify the code from our class
          materials). Once you fulfill the minimum requirements with your own code, you are
          allowed to get the code from the web (with source attribution) to incorporate certain
          advanced components (e.g. image galleries with transitions), but they will not count as
          part of the minimum requirements.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <p>Provide a clear, specific description of your plan for building the site. Outline
          the tasks to be accomplished, the deadlines for those tasks, and who is responsible
          for them. Include a list of files and folders, which will help each partner link to files her
          partner has built. Include a complete list of everything you need to get from your
          client (text, pictures, sound, etc.) and when you expect to get them. To the greatest
          extent you can, try to have all of these things by the time your design is done so that
          nothing will delay your coding.
